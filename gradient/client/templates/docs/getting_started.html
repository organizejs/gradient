# Integrating with Gradient

In order to start selling your products through Gradient and utilizing a sliding scale, you need to connect your store to Gradient. 

## Pre-requisites
Please make sure you have the following pre-requisites:

- A Stripe account
- A Gradient vendor account with your Stripe Keys and Re-direct URL configured

For more information on the above, visit the [home page]({{ url_for('user.account') }}).

## Overview

Integrating Gradient into your store requires the following:

1. Pass a cart object to Gradient to start the checkout process.
2. Handle a transaction response from Gradient, notifying that the customer has either successfully completed the checkout process, or that the checkout has failed.

## Starting a Gradient checkout

On your checkout page, add the following to include the Gradient frontend library:

```html
<script src="https://www.gradient.care/assets/js/gradient.js"></script>
```

This provides a JavaScript function, `gradientCheckout`, that initiates the Gradient checkout process. It takes two arguments: your Gradient vendor ID ([available on your account page]({{ url_for('vendor.account') }})) and a list of products that the customer is purchasing (i.e. the cart).

The items in the cart must be JavaScript object with at least the following keys: 

- `id` - the product id
- `min_price` - the minumum price of the product, in cents
- `max_price` - the maximum price of the product, in cents
- `sku` - the product's SKU

You can optionally also include:

- `image_url` - a url for a thunbnail to use for the checkout process (recommended size: 300px X 300px)
- `name` - the fully qualified name of the product


For example:

```javascript
const gradientVendorID = 1;

document.getElementById('checkout-with-gradient').addEventListener('click', function() {
    gradientCheckout(gradientVendorID, [{
        id: 12,
        max_price: 5000, // $50.00
        min_price: 1000, // $10.00
        sku: 'CM01-R',
        name: 'Micky\'s Magnificant Chocolate Milkshake',
        image_url: 'https://www.mickymilkshakes.com/images/chocolate_milkshake_thumbnail.jpg'
    }, {
        id: 16,
        max_price: 6000, // $50.00
        min_price: 2000, // $10.00
        sku: 'XR02-B'
        name: 'Micky\'s Magnificant Greentea Limited Edition Milkshake',
        image_url: 'https://www.mickymilkshakes.com/images/greentea_milkshake_thumbnail.jpg
    }]);
});
```

This binds the `gradientCheckout` function a button with ID `checkout-with-gradient`.

Once the user clicks on this button, the Gradient checkout process will begin.

## Handling a completed Gradient transaction

Once the customer finishes the Gradient checkout process, we will redirect them to the redirect URL you specified when signing up.

Our JavaScript library provides an additional function, `completeGradientCheckout`, which should be called to verify that the Gradient transaction successfully completed and that the redirection for the transaction is authentic. This takes two arguments: an `onSuccess` callback and an `onFailure` callback.

Your redirect page might include, for example:

```javascript
completeGradientCheckout(function() {
    alert('Thank you for your purchase!');
}, function() {
    alert('Something went wrong during your checkout.');
});
```

You might also want to communicate with your own system to record that transaction as completed so you can begin your fulfillment process.
